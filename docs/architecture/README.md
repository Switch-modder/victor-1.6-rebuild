## Victor Architecture

* [Hardware](whats_in_victor.md)

* [System Architecture Overview](arch_overview.md): Organization of processes and components, and communication between them

* [Simulated vs. Physical Robots](physical_vs_sim.md) 

* [Observable Objects](observableObjects.md): Things the robot can see and estimate the pose of

* [BlockWorld](blockWorld.md) / [FaceWorld](faceWorld.md) / [PetWorld](faceWorld.md): How objects/faces are stored, and coordinate frame "rejiggering"

* [Vision Component/System](visionSystem.md)

* [Poses](poses.md): Representing position, uncertainty, and kinematic chains & trees

* [Path Planner](planner.md): How Victor gets form A to B and navigates around obstacles

* [Mapping](map.md): Helps provide information on obstacles/driveability to the planner

* [Actions](actions.md) 

* [Animations](animations.md): Perform coordinated movements with sound

* [Behaviors](behaviors.md): Coordinated actions and animations 

* [Emotion System](emotions.md): Track the robot's emotional state to drive behaviors and animation

* [Cube Connection](cubeConnections.md): Connect to cubes to allow lights/sensor data collection

* Testing 
   * Unit tests for engine
   * unit tests for coretech
   * Webots tests (sometimes fail!)
