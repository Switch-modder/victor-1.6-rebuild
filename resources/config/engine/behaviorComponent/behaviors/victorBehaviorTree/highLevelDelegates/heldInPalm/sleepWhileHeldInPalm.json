  // behavior such as TriggerWordDetected, the robot should not
  // want to sleep again as soon as that higher priority behavior
  // deactivates and allows HeldInPalmResponses to re-activate.
  // Instead, the sleeping behavior should wait to be in-scope
  // for a few seconds, to allow some other HIP response behavior
  // to be active, then return the robot to sleep. This prevents
  // the robot from abruptly just activating the sleep animations
  // as soon as the robot is done with the higher-priority behavior
